## Documentation

### Download
For first, you need to download this repository to your PC.
You can do that with two ways:

1. Clone this repository https://github.com/wonderlaw1/project_template.git
2. Click "download" on this rep page

### Using

Here I separated project on two components

1. src(where you'll write your code)
2. build(where compiled files would be)

For using, you need to install node modules.
You just to need in your downloaded project enter in console command "npm install", and all modules would be installed.
